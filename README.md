# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS or current version recommended)
- npm, Yarn, or pnpm package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <URL_REPOSITORY>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <NAMA_FOLDER_PROYEK>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
   Using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server, run:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
Using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Accessing the Application

Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

This will open the React application powered by Vite with Hot Module Replacement enabled.

## Scripts

Here are the available scripts for this project:

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server with HMR.
- **`build`**: Bundles the application for production.
- **`preview`**: Serves the production build locally for testing.
